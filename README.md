# Lil_Cars
A simple p5.js project evolving cars to drive around a randomly generated road.

## New Features

- On screen statistics panel shows the current frame, number of cars and fitness
  data.
- After a fixed duration the simulation automatically saves a `run_report.json`
  file summarizing the best and average distance travelled and the genome of the
  best car.

## Future Improvements

- Tune the mutation strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
- Consider reducing unused code and comments to simplify maintenance.
